<h3>1.- The first thing is to separate the whites from the yolks. We separate in two bowls, to the one with the yolks we add the vanilla and the sour cream or fresh cream, we beat until all the ingredients are fully integrated. And in another bowl we are going to mount the egg whites. Add the sugar and with some manual or electric rods, mount until they reach the point of snow.</h3>
<h3>2.-Add the flour and chemical yeast to the cream of the yolks with the cream. Mix very well so that there are no lumps. This cream has to be thick and creamy consistency.</h3>
<h3>3.-Now is the time to add the whipped egg whites to another bowl with the pancake batter. First we pour 1/3 of the whites over the flour dough and integrate with some manual rods, very slowly, integrating little by little, being careful not to lower the whites.</h3>
<h3>4.-Then we add the rest and incorporate it into the base cream, we do it in several batches and with enveloping movements. It is important to incorporate the air from the egg whites into the dough to give it that sponginess that we want the hot cake to have.</h3>

<h2>HOW TO MAKE THE HOT-CAKES</h2>
<p aling= "justify">
<h3>Put a little butter in a non-stick frying pan. When it starts to melt, remove the excess butter with a clean kitchen paper. I usually pierce a bit of butter with a fork and rub the hot pan, so we don't lose any butter.</h3>
<h3>Once the entire surface is greased, pour a portion of dough or cream into the pan with a ladle or large spoon.</h3>
<h3>We let them brown on one side and when they come out bubbles we can turn them over, about 2-3 minutes per side more or less. They have to be well sealed so that sponges remain inside, you will see it, the bubbles grow and expand.</h3>
<h3>And that's it, we have the perfect hot-cakes and it's time to eat them. That enjoy them!</h3>
